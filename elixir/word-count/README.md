# Word Count

Write a program that given a phrase can count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```plain
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```


## Running tests

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)
